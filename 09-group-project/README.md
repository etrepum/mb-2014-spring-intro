# Group Project Planning

Continue planning of group projects. I don't think we can expect to
get to coding yet. We should take care of the administrative issues:

* Get them set up with Trello
* Create a GitHub repository for each group
* Show them how to use the GitHub wiki for formalizing their ideas

> We didn't show them GitHub's wiki feature but we did the rest.
> Re-ordered the bullets to the same order that it happened in.

Maybe we should have groups plan for the first half, and pitch to the
class for the second half? Perhaps this is better saved for Thursday.

> We had the groups pitch their idea at the beginning so the people
> who were absent the previous day could decide which group to join.
