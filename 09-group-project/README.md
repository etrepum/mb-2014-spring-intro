# Group Project Planning

Continue planning of group projects. I don't think we can expect to
get to coding yet. We should take care of the administrative issues:

* Create a GitHub repository for each group
* Show them how to use the GitHub wiki for formalizing their ideas
* Get them set up with Trello

Maybe we should have groups plan for the first half, and pitch to the
class for the second half? Perhaps this is better saved for Thursday.
