# DeNA field trip

We did a class trip to DeNA, where the students got to talk to several
DeNA employee: Sarah Fuchs (head of culture & communication),
an engineer (forgot his name), Steven Garcia (Lead Engineer),
and Mark Barnes (VP of Engineering).

The students also got a tour of the office and the kitchen :)
