# Group Projects

Continue working on group projects. We should have GitHub and Trello
set up by this point.

At this point we should have them start doing actual work. One idea
would be to make non-functional mockups (storyboards) of game screens
in HTML or images. Another is to just get them started with an
appropriate library for their game (Impact, Cocos2d, Crafty, melon, &hellip;)?

Dulce suggested I should talk about how animation works (sprites,
sprite sheets, etc.).
