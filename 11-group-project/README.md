# Group Projects

Continue working on group game projects.

We started experimenting with game engines last week, here are the
ones we recommended:

* http://melonjs.org/
* http://iioengine.com/
* http://phaser.io/

Here are the groups: https://github.com/MissionBit/mentors/wiki/Spring-2014-Intro-Lick-Wilmerding#wiki-group-project-1

Here's a completed version of the melonjs tutorial:

Looking through the diffs might help if someone gets stuck, for
example:
