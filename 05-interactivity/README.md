# Group Project Planning

(save for day 6?)

At the half, organize the students by interest to pitch a project
idea. The project should go a bit beyond what we've learned so far,
but not too much. The maximum sort of complexity that would make sense
would be something equivalent to Flappy Bird, or a site with a handful
of separate pages. We'll tailor the lessons to cover techniques that
will be necessary to complete the projects.

Rough project ideas should be pitched by the end of class.
